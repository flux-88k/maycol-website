      <h2>ORTESOL</h2>
      <p>
        As an ESOL instructor, using ORTESOL helps me stay informed about current research, culturally responsive
        practices, and inclusive teaching strategies that directly support equity in the classroom.
        ORTESOL helps connect instructors with a network of experienced educators who share best practices for meeting
        the diverse needs of English learners. “In such cases, the educational realities of multilingual
        learners continue to reflect monolingual pedagogical orientations that promote a dominant language,
        often at the expense of promoting multilingualism and/or heritage language maintenance.” (Chang-Bacon, 2022)
        The explanation that we get from Chang-Bacon is what ORTESOL is all about and why it is an essential tool to
        help expand the knowledge of students and also support instructors not only in Oregon but wherever the ELs
        support is needed.

      <h2>Colorin Colorado</h2>
      <p>
        Colorin Colorado is a great website where teachers can find support due to the expansive amount of resources
        that instructors can use to be able to best create a room of learning for their EL students.
        Colorin Colorado in particular is effective in supporting equitable teaching because it
        emphasizes culturally responsive practices, linguistic inclusion, and family engagement.
        I think their best option is the way they are able to provide various examples of things,
        not having articles but videos supporting and also real life people explanations on things
        that happen within an issue or topic. ““Bilingual students’ language practices… are often stigmatized.
        Translanguaging permits students and teachers to acknowledge as valid the full range of
        linguistic practices… and to use these practices for improved teaching and learning.” (Garcia, 2014)
        I specifically feel that Colorin Colorado is a great translanguaging support as many of the videos and articles
        are both in english and various languages that we see everyday in our schools.

      <h2>Tesol.org</h2>
      <p>
        TESOL provides a wide range of teaching materials, lesson plans, and research-based strategies specifically
        for ELs. Which is helpful for any level of teaching trying to get some support to better educate their students.
        But it not only helps with direct instruction but also has a focus that helps teachers create inclusive
        classrooms where ELs feel valued and supported, which is critical for their academic success.
        Through webinars, workshops, and conferences available on their website,
        TESOL offers ongoing professional development for educators so that they are always able to grow with new
        methods and stay up to date with the best practices for the schools they work at.
        “New standards provide new opportunities for educators to design instruction aimed at increasing the
        participation, meaning-making practices, and achievement of EL students.” (Neri, 2016) Neri and the
        other authors nail it when they speak about new standards being introduced every school year and the
        preparation that educators need to be able to build success in their room, that being said
        I believe that TESOL is one of those resources that help develop educators until the end of their career.
