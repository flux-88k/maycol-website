      <h2>Google Docs</h2>
      <p>
        Google Docs is a good resource for students to use as they are learning english because they are able
        to write in a new language and developing vocabulary and while it is in their own words or own language, they are
        able to share these documents with others and the teacher to be able to receive feedback from peers and learn
        together. This also allows the students to become familiar with the idea of essay writing depending on the level
        or grade that the student is in and prepare them for a higher education as this is a resource that is used in most
        cases until the end of an educational path for any student. Teachers can insert vocabulary exercises,
        sentence frames, and discussion prompts directly into documents related to content lessons as well and this is
        important because in the article “Five Essential Practices to Teach Designated ELD & Integrate ELD into Content”
        we learn that it is key that we “CLARIFY NEW LANGUAGE AND CONCEPTS USING A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES AND MODALITIES”
        and on of those is using systems like google docs.

      <h2>Padlet.com</h2>
      <p>
        In the article by Zwiers “Literacy Practices that Adolescents Deserve: Opportunities to Participate in
        Oral Communication” we learn about the importance of oral development and after looking at the padlet,
        we see how we are able to use it to benefit el and help them develop orally. The use of padlet facilitates
        authentic, interactive communication by allowing students to post voice recordings, videos, and text responses
        leading to and engaging them in meaningful oral practice and creativity. “Adolescents deserve frequent
        opportunities to participate in meaningful oral communication where they can use language in authentic contexts,
        express their ideas, and collaborate with peers. These interactions support the development of academic language
        and critical thinking.” (Zwiers, 2014).

      <h2>Quill.org</h2>
      <p>
        “Teach through real conversations as much as possible, a conversion can be a part of a mini lesson that leads
        to the development of grammar” (Zwiers, Crawford, 2011). And although in a perfect world we would all develop
        a language through direct conversation, it’s not always possible. That's why I believe that websites like quill
        help students build their knowledge of English grammar and are able to apply it when they interact with their
        peers to have a sense of a head start. This site can even be used in pairs and can help interact with one another
        virtually with recording abilities to be able to give feedback that students need to continue to develop language.
