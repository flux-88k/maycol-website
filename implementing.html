      <h2>Kahoot</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to implementing technology into our daily routine as teachers and students we are able to see the
        variety of ways in which technology can help us receive and interpret information. Kahoot is an example of what
        a teacher can use to be able to create formative assessments that allows him or her to see where the students
        are based on the content in the class. “Formative assessment is an ongoing process used by teachers and
        students during instruction that provides feedback to adjust ongoing teaching and learning to improve students’
        achievement of intended instructional outcomes.” (WIDA) This app also allows students to challenge each other
        and have fun, a teacher could even use a group method in this app.

      <h2>Readtheory</h2>
      <p>
        During week 6 we learned about the importance of reading and how for the majority of ELs, that's where teachers
        lose them the most due to the complexity of reading different types of passages and its demanding vocabulary.
        William Grabe wrote about the key issues behind the development of reading skills in L2s specifically but most
        of his findings can be applied to any language learner of any level. Reading takes a different approach each
        time, and like he said in the article, some passages you need to dive deeper, get the evidence but in some
        cases you can read for fun and that's where we can find a disconnect in students. Using ReadTheory in the
        classroom has helped clear the blur between that idea as it is a place where students can read interesting
        topics for them but develop academic language at the same time as they are reading things that are
        informational but also at the level they need to stay engaged.

      <h2>Quizlet.com</h2>
      <p>
        Although ReadTheory is a great tool for reading and kahoot is a great tool to examine students and create
        conversation, Quizlet is a great way to get a mix of both and more. In the article on Colorin Colorado;
        selecting vocabulary words to teach English language learners “ELLs need many more exposures to a word and
        more explicit instruction in word meanings and usage than their native-speaking peers. They benefit from
        seeing, hearing, saying, and writing new words in a variety of contexts.” That being said quizlet have many
        tools that allow students to study their new vocabulary, apply it into word sentences and listen to the
        pronunciation of the word as they are learning them.
